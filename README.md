# Automatic webtiles server
This is an ansible playbook to quickly get a working webtiles server up and running.
**work in progress**

## Getting started
First install the required ansible roles.
```
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
```
Secondly, run vagrant up to try it out locally.
```
vagrant up
```
Now you have a fully working webtiles server.

More to come...
